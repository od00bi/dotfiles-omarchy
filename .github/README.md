# dotfiles-omarchy

My omarchy dotfiles.

## Usage

To set up for the first time or for subsequent updates, run the init bash script:

```sh 
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/od00bi/dotfiles-omarchy-test/refs/heads/main/.dotfiles/init.sh | sh
```

The script will clone the repo if it does not exist or pull updates if it does.
